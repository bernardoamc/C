Output if standard output is redirected to a terminal:

  If I had more time,
  I would have written you a shorter letter.

Output if standard output is redirected to a disk file:

  I would have written you a shorter letter.
  If I had more time,

Why this happens?

write() calls are not buffered, so the answer lies within the printf() call.
If the output is redirected to a terminal a newline will automatically flush
the buffer. This will not happen if the output is redirected to a file, so the
printf() call gets buffered and will be flushed in the following situations:
  - manually (calling fflush)
  - If the buffer is full
  - If we the process is terminated
